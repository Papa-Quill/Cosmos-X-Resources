To use this method right, you must put your script file in zip\maps\, and it must be a specific map. 
If I wanted to make a script for 2Fort, the script file would be zip\maps\ctf_2fort_commentary.

To use the tool, you must open TF2 on your xbox and in a match, or in the main menu execute the exe. 
Please set your console as your default console in xbox neighborhood

To use these scripts, you must enter the command commentary 1 after executing the exe and confirming it worked.

The only limit I'm aware of is not being able to make geometry like you can in hammer, and the files needing to be under a certain length.

To get a better description and what not, please join the Discord server in the main README file.
